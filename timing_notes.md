Both compiled and uncompiled functions, when doing repeat runs, have the same precompile time, about 8000ms.
It seems to take more than 5 hours of not running the function for the precompilation to invalidate itself.
Package-compiling greatly improves the run-time of local builds but seems to make little/no difference for Lambda functions.
